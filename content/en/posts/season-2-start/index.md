To participate, you must attend school on Monday, January 27th, where you’ll compete with others in a secret game for the prize. Prepare for surprises—you’ll need both skill and creativity to claim victory!
# What’s New in Season 2?
## The Plan:

Just as before, we’ll embark on the ambitious mission of creating a brand-new game together. Using a follow-along method, we’ll develop the same core game as a group. However, here’s the twist:
💡 You’ll personalize your version by making your own code and design decisions. It’s your chance to make the game uniquely yours, while still learning alongside your peers.
🌟 A Rough Idea Becomes Reality:

Just before Season 1 ended, we brainstormed a rough idea for our game—and now, it’s time to bring that idea to life!

To give you a clearer example and get you excited, we’ll more or less be remaking a game called Rabbit and Steel. This game is perfect for our class:

> Small in scope, making it manageable for everyone. Vast in possibilities, providing plenty of opportunities to teach key concepts while encouraging you to build upon its foundation.

This will serve as an amazing framework for both learning and creativity, with tons of room to grow and make it your own.  
## What’s Changing?
### 1. No active participation required during online sessions / youtube:

Last season, we experimented with online gatherings, it wasn’t working for everyone. This time, online sessions are optional and will be structured differently to better suit your pace.  
### 2. More frequent offline meetups:

While it’s no small feat for me to travel 100km just to meet you all, I’m making the commitment to host at least one offline meetup every month. This is the cost I’ve chosen to pay to ensure we no longer need active online participation.

### Here’s what I need from you:
Do your best during the follow-along lessons. Bring your questions, challenges, and progress to the offline meetups. These in-person sessions will serve as opportunities to reinforce your skills, clarify concepts, and strengthen what you’ve learned.


### 3. No exams or graded practices:

This season, there will be no exams or structured assignments that I set, collect, and grade. Instead, the focus is on your progress and what you choose to create.

🛠️ What I’ll supervise:

> Your follow-along project progress: How you personalize the base game and make it uniquely yours. Your final project: Whatever amazing creation you decide to build at the end of the course.

This approach puts the power in your hands—you control your learning journey and how far you take it. My role is simply to guide, give feedback, and cheer you on as you grow.

Let’s dive deep, create boldly, and discover what lies beyond the shore. Are you ready? The horizon is waiting—fill out the form today and join us for another unforgettable season!
