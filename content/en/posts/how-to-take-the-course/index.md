## How to Take This Class

This class is designed to be experienced from start to finish, following a structured journey where each lesson builds upon the previous one. Unlike modular tutorials that allow you to jump between topics, this class follows a continuous development process. As we progress, we will deliberately introduce both intentional and unintentional mistakes—just as they occur in real-world coding. This approach mirrors the organic way of learning programming: making errors, debugging them, and improving our code over time.

Because of this structure, skipping around different sections may lead to confusion, as later lessons rely on knowledge and corrections from previous ones. To get the most out of this class, follow it sequentially and engage with each lesson in order.

## Hands-On Learning

This is not a passive learning experience. To truly grasp the material, you should:
- Run the code yourself. Experiment with it, modify it, and observe how changes affect the output.
- Engage with examples. If a section contains code that is purely for demonstration and not meant to be followed step-by-step, I will explicitly mention it. Otherwise, assume that you should try it yourself.
- Pay attention to important highlights. When a section is especially crucial, I will indicate it clearly.

By actively participating in the learning process, you will reinforce your understanding and develop problem-solving skills essential for real-world programming.

## Class Resources

All source code and assets used in this class will be stored on my personal GitHub repository.

If you’re unfamiliar with GitHub, think of it as a place where developers share and manage code. You don’t need prior GitHub knowledge to follow the class—just consider it a reference point where you can access the class materials when needed.
Asking Questions

If you find anything unclear or need a more in-depth explanation, you are encouraged to ask questions. You can reach out to me or discuss with fellow students through our Discord community. Collaboration and discussion will help reinforce concepts and provide additional perspectives on problem-solving.

## Platform Compatibility

This class is designed with **Windows** in mind. If you are using Linux, I assume you are experienced enough to make the necessary adjustments on your own.

By following these recommendations, you will maximize your learning experience and build strong programming foundations.
