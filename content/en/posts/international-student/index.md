This season, we’re thrilled to announce something truly special: GameDev: Beyond the Shore will be welcoming international students into our journey! 🌟  
## How It Works

Our international friends will join us online, as they won’t be able to attend the offline meetups. They’ll be active members of our class, participating through:

1. Discord Server Interaction: They’ll join the same Discord server as everyone else, allowing them to interact with the rest of the class just like any other student.
2. Follow-Along Lessons: They’ll work on the same follow-along project, adding their unique twists and contributions.
3. Feedback and Support: They’ll share their progress, receive feedback, and exchange ideas with everyone.

While they may be oceans away, they’ll still be a vital part of our creative community. 🌊  
## Why This Is Exciting

This is more than just an opportunity to expand our class—it’s a chance for all of us to grow as developers:

- 🌍 Exchange Ideas: Collaborate with students from different backgrounds, gaining new perspectives and ideas that you may not have considered before.
- 🤝 Build Connections: Forge friendships and connections with like-minded developers from other parts of the world.
- 💡 Learn Together: Share knowledge, troubleshoot challenges, and celebrate progress as one unified community of game developers.

Having international students join us is like opening a window to a bigger world—one where creativity and innovation know no borders.
## What Does This Mean for Our Class?

For our local students:

- You’ll still have your offline meetups as planned, where we’ll dive deeper into lessons, troubleshoot, and enhance our projects.
- However, now you’ll also have the chance to collaborate with international peers during the online portion of the class.

For our international students:

- You’ll participate fully in the online components of the class, interacting with everyone through Discord, sharing your progress, and learning alongside the rest of the group.
- Though you can’t join the offline meetups, we’ll make sure you stay just as engaged and supported in your learning journey.

This is a season where our classroom stretches beyond physical walls and becomes a global space for creativity. Let’s make the most of this incredible opportunity to learn, create, and grow together. 🌟

Welcome aboard, international students! We can’t wait to see what you’ll bring to GameDev: Beyond the Shore.
