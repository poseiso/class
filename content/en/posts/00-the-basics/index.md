I'll go through the basic explanation as we go, for now let's get our bearing by downloading the things we need
and that is the godot engine itself
- instruction to download the latest version from the website-
and that's all you need

If you have never programmed like NEVER before
here's the basic of basic things you need to know:
[Link to post]

Now let's create a new project
open the downloaded godot
this will be the godot project management screen
click on create
and give the title of the project and its path
i will nname my project Arnab dan Besi
but you can give it whatever you want
for the rest of the setting
leave it as is
if you encounter an error during this setup please let me know

Now we're inside the engine itself
might be a little bit Overwhelming but it's quite simple if you know where to look and pay attention to

On the left side is where you will find your scene *Node* (I will explain this later) and your project directory / files
and on the right side there will be properties explorer of your selected node

For now this is the things you need  to know about the editor

- Node and scene explanation here

Now that we get a rough idea of what node and scene is let's freate our first scene
we're going to make the scene of our character
i'll name it heavy_blade.tscn since that's the character that i'm going to make
after we created the scene there will be nothing 
since the scene has no node as of yet
for the root node we'll add a characterbody2d
rename the Root node with same name as the scene
in this case it'll be HeavyBlade
for now add sprite and collisionshape 2d as its child nodes

Now that we have built the basic node hiearchy for our character scene
i will explain what each node do
again we'll discover what each node do as we develop more things for our game there's no pressure to know all what the nodes do

For CharacterBody2D
